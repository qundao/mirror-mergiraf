# Installation

You can install Mergiraf with `cargo install mergiraf --bin mergiraf`.

You can also download binaries manually and place them somewhere in your `$PATH`.


## Pssst! Why don't you install Difftastic too?

[Difftastic](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/) is a fantastic structural diff tool which works great in combination with Mergiraf.
